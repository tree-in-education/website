    <p class="underline-border"><b>Corporate Partnerships</b></p>
    <p>The TREE Lab does partner with corporate companies to host events about inclusion in tech. We have partnered in the past with Google, Facebook, Amazon, Boeing, and other companies to learn of their efforts to make technolgoy more accessible and equitable.

    <p class="underline-border"><b>Non-Profit Partnerships</b></p>
    <p>We have partnered in the past with organizations from museums to high schools and believe that since technology is an interdisciplinary subject it requires an interdisciplinary approach. Typically, we arrange a meeting to discuss our aligned goals and what segment of the TREE Lab the organization would like to join or through collaboration a new joint venture can blossom.

    <p>At the TREE Lab we encourage growth through any ethical means possible. We encourage students to initialize their own projects and pitch them to Northwestern faculty or collaborate with community organizations in the greater Chicago area. Also, Dr. Sepehr Vakil teaches a course SESP 351 Technology and Ethics that provides undergraduate students an introduction to critically thinking about the roles of privacy, government, and how technology influences communities. </p>
    <p class="underline-border"><b>Government Partnerships</b></p>
    <p>Our work examines the role of technology in larger society including its intersections in government. We have collaborated with government offices in the past as well as founded campaigns to end the use of facial recognition in Chicago. We are welcome to collaboration with government offices to share perspectives and grow together as ethical technologists .
