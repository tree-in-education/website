Rhea is a third-year undergraduate student studying Computer Science and Economics. She has been a part of the TREE collective since it started in the summer of 2019, when she worked with it as a SURAP student. That summer, she built a facial recognition demonstration for YPRPT students to teach them more about the technologies that they interact with everyday. She has also created demonstrations on Algorithms and Databases.

She is really excited about how quickly the collective is taking off and accomplishing so many things, and she can't wait to see what lies in the future of TREE.

In her free time, Rhea enjoys reading, watching movies, running, and traveling.
