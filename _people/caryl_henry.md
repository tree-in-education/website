Caryl is a junior majoring in Computer Science while pursuing a minor in Psychology, the Segal Design Certificate, Integrated Marketing Communications Certificate, and Digital Media Module. She also has conducted Human-Computer Interaction research through COMP_SCI 315: Design, Technology, and Research. Caryl’s diverse academic background and experience in Human-Computer Interaction research has made her passionate about developing technology responsibly such that helping people is at the forefront.

She’s a big fan of music that was cool in 2007 and is a major nerd when it comes to anything Nintendo or anime. Also, Caryl says “process” and “adult” weirdly because she picked up the Canadian pronunciation by watching too many HGTV shows based in Canada when she was younger.
