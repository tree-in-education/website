Jessie is a former high school social studies educator and life-long Chicagoan. She is currently pursuing her Phd in Learning Sciences at Northwestern where she spends a lot of time thinking about school-based civic education. 

Prior to graduate school, Jessie served as the Director of Social Science and Civic Engagement for the Chicago Public Schools where her work with educators and students led her to partner with scholars on a <a href="https://www.civicsurvey.org/sites/default/files/publications/LetsGoThere_Paper_V17.pdf" target="_blank">Lived Civics</a> approach to civic education.  

She hopes to contribute to a reimagining of civics, where issues of race, identity and lived experience are understood as central to learning.  As a member of the YPRPT team, Jessie helped to co-design learning activities with YPRPT partners as well as support research on the program itself.
