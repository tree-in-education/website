Ally is a PhD student and graduate worker studying Learning Sciences in the School of Education and Social Policy, and a 2019 and 2020 NSF-NRT IDEAS Integrated Data Science Fellow. She serves on the student advisory board for Northwestern’s Office of Equity in addition to Northwestern's Community Safety Advisory Board. In her work with TREE Lab, she aims to disentangle the complex sociopolitical and ethical dimensions of AI-based ed-tech and other technologies in learning spaces. Looking forward, her dissertation work will explore what school districts mean (and what implications arise) when they describe decision-making as “data-driven”, and how data, broadly construed, is conceptualized, operationalized, and politicized in schools.
