The Mary and Leigh Block Museum of Art enriches teaching and learning on the campuses of Northwestern University and in the communities of their surrounding regions by: 

(1) Presenting art across time, cultures, and media; (2) convening interdisciplinary discussions in which art is a springboard for exploring issues and ideas, and (3) collecting art that supports the Northwestern University curriculum.
