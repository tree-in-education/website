Endangered Peace Productions writes, produces, and directs original film works, while creating video content for corporate brands and educational institutions. 

Their film & video producers are committed to generating content that is both contemporary and equitable; and acknowledge the ways in which underrepresented peopleâ€™s livelihoods, perspectives, and inherent peace remain in a state of danger. 

They take pride in mentoring the next generation, and maintaining productive creative relationships, while having fun along the way.
