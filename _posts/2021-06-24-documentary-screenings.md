After six months of a fully online program guided by an innovative participatory curriculum, YPRPT’s second run has culminated with eleven short documentaries that investigate ethical and social possibilities and perils wrought by new technologies.

The 2021 iteration of YPRPT has been a six-month collaboration with twelve community organizations and schools in Chicago and Evanston:

All 11 of the short films created in the 2021 YPRPT program will be available to watch for a 7-day period on the Block’s Vimeo (see links below). A live screening of three YPRPT films selected by the student filmmakers will take place on Thursday, June 24 at 5 pm CST followed by a live audience Q&A with the artists and program participants.
