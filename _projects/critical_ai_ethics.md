The Critical AI Ethics Curriculum working group is a collaboration with Northwestern University School of Education and Social Policy’s TREE Lab, Evanston Township High School, Responsible AI Student Organization (RAISO), and the Kapor Center.  

The working group consists of researchers, undergraduate students, and high school students and educators working together to create a set of educational resources to help students explore, understand, and question the social and ethical dimensions of AI. 

The resources will include lesson plans, syllabi, pedagogical essays, activity designs, and youth-produced artifacts, for use within a range of settings including K12 classrooms, college courses, and out of school programs. Our team is currently developing educational resources in the following topic areas: AI and surveillance, AI and militarism, AI and social media, and AI in K12 public education. 

**If you are interested in using these resources, please email Professor Sepehr Vakil at sepehr.vakil@northwestern.edu. We will be releasing a Critical AI Ethics K12 resource guide in Summer 2024. Please check back here for updates.**
