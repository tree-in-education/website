    YPRPT (Young People’s Race Power and Tech Project) is an afterschool program co-designed with community partners to engage Chicago youth in critical inquiry around around the complex ethical and political dimensions of technologies. Bringing together civics, computing, and the arts, YPRPT aims to contribute to a reimagining of what “technology learning” is and could be in an era of ubiquitous computing.

## The Young People's Race, Power, and Technology Project (YPRPT)

YPRPT is an NSF-funded learning initiative designed specifically for middle school and high school students. The program offers an innovative research-based curriculum that empowers youth to explore, engage, critique, and reimagine the role of technology in their neighborhoods, schools, and communities. YPRPT brings together high school and undergraduate students from Northwestern University, educators, community workers, and university researchers to understand the impact, limitations, harms, and possibilities that new technologies offer, particularly for historically marginalized communities of color. The program integrates “under the hood” investigations of technologies with documentary film-making, and a focus on building and sustaining community among all collaborators and participants.

Starting in 2019, we have worked alongside community partners across Chicagoland to co-design learning experiences for young people to examine the interconnections between technology, racism, and power. Since the first iteration of YPRPT, we have collaborated and built deep relationships with the [Lucy Parsons Labs](/partners/#lucy-parsons-labs) and [Family Matters](/partners/#family-matters) in Chicago's Rogers Park neighborhood. 

## YPRPT x Kapor Center pilot 2022
In 2022, we piloted a new iteration of YPRPT in collaboration with our partners the [Lucy Parsons Labs](/partners/#lucy-parsons-labs) and [Family Matters](/partners/#family-matters), with support from the <a href = "https://www.kaporcenter.org/" target="_blank">Kapor Center </a>. A cohort of six high schoolers investigated and co-designed curricular units exploring the ethical complexities of a technology of their choice. 

Check out the first drafts of the 2022 cohort's 5 curricular units below:

## YPRPT 2021
The COVID-19 pandemic shaped the second year of YPRPT–we shifted to a fully-remote format and expanded to include a larger number of organizations and young people. Twelve teams–comprised of high schoolers, undergraduates, and representatives from community groups like arts organizations, churches, and afterschool programs–were guided through a 4-month curriculum co-designed to encourage  exploration of technology and its impacts, as well as documentary filmmaking and production. Ten final documentary films were premiered at an online film festival, hosted by our partner, [The Block Museum of Art + Block Cinema](/partners/#block-museum).  

Visit the 2021 YPRPT Film Festival portal [here](/pages/#yprpt-film-festival-2021), where you can watch all of the youth-produced documentaries!

## YPRPT 2019-2020
During the first pilot of YPRPT, high schoolers created and produced their own documentary films probing the intersections of particular technologies, bringing forth questions of justice and ethics that emerged during their exploration. The program culimnated in a special film screening hosted by our partner, [The Block Museum of Art + Block Cinema](/partners/#block-museum). 

Watch the documentaries from YPRPT's 2019-2020 cohort <a href="https://vimeo.com/showcase/7260847" target="_blank">here.</a>


<!-- In January 2021 YPRPT will launch its second cohort, using lessons learned from the pilot year and re-tooling in the context of COVID and emerging opportunities to expand the reach of the program. We’re expanding the program to include a select number of community orgs and schools from across the Chicago area.

## How will the program work during COVID-19?
Teams will be connected to an online community of youth, activists, artists, and Northwestern student mentors; get access to a research-based curriculum hosted on an online platform; participate in monthly virtual meet-ups, and create an original documentary film exploring critical technology and social justice issues in their neighborhood. Students and community organizations will be able to be part of the program using technology they already have. Access to computers/laptops is also preferred but not required. If there are questions or concerns about technology access, you can contact us. 

## What does the documentary film-making part of the program look like? 
Students will work with their team to learn documentary filmmaking skills. They will be able to use their smartphones, tablets, and computers to record videos, take pictures, and edit. If a team has access to digital cameras, they are welcomed, but not required. The YPRPT will provide teams with audio recording equipment and access to Adobe Premiere CC software licenses. Examples of documentary topics include: telling a story about the role of technology in your lives/neighborhood, exploring the politics of Chicago and technology, social media, etc. At the end of the program, students will have the opportunity to have their films featured in a special screening at the Block Museum at Northwestern University where their films will be viewed by hundreds of viewers. 


## Time/Work Commitment
Teams should expect to commit 2-5 hrs/week from **January 2021 - June 2021**. Below are some expectations as being part of the program: 
* Teams will participate consistently in a self-guided, online YPRPT curriculum which will include required modules to be completed and submitted to program directors at the end of each month. 
* Each organization should have a plan to meet weekly with their teams. For example, your organization should plan a regular date & time (1-2 hours/week) to meet with your student team(s). Mentors will be available to meet with teams at their regular weekly meetings to support with program content & video editing. 
* Teams will have access to office-hours for assistance with the program content and video editing
* Teams will participate in monthly, city-wide virtual meet-ups to learn and connect with other teams 
* Teams will work with their UC Northwestern mentor, along with support from award-winning artists, technologists, and activists, to create an original short documentary exploring the intersections of tech and racial justice. Teams will have access to virtual office-hours with local filmmaker & weekly virtual meetings with their Northwestern Undergraduate Collaborator
* Teams will compete with other teams across the city in a documentary film festival. Best films will be featured in a special screening hosted by the Block Museum at Northwestern University in Summer 2021. 


## Who is this program open to & how can my community organization apply? 

<span class="news">DEADLINE EXTENDED!</span> **Tuesday, December 8th, 2020** 

This program is open to youth-serving community organizations in Chicago & surrounding areas. We are currently accepting applications for community-organizations to participate in YPRPT, which launches virtually in Winter 2021. To participate, community-orgs are required to submit a “youth team.” Each team will consist of 1-2 adult mentors representing the community organization, and 2-5 high school aged youth. 

Applications are due by **Tuesday, December 8th 2020** using <a href="https://forms.gle/ktpok5VMYRcfcS3N9" target="_blank">this application</a>. We also require that you have a list of students in mind for a team since we will be asking you to distribute consent forms among the students. 

**Note**: If teams are not part of a formal community organization, they may still submit an application but there should be an adult mentor who can serve as the Team Lead. For example, an adult mentor can be a teacher or other adult that is willing to serve as the Team Lead for the duration of the program. 

## What does the research part of YPRPT look like? 
Community organizations, team leaders, and students do not need to participate in the research to choose to implement this program or be part of the program. However, those who choose to participate will be compensated for their participation and allowing us to record the program for research purposes. The recordings will help us understand how to best support student learning of complex technical and societal issues.
