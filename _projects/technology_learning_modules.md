The Facial Recognition Group aims to educate on facial recognition and surveillance technologies by creating a learning module accessible to all that breaks down technical concepts and describes social implications. Future goals include creating other course modules that engage in ethical critique and explain technical concepts like machine learning and algorithmic bias. Within our course modules we want to engage and educate learners through building interactive demos, telling stories, and explaining algorithms using pseudocode.
