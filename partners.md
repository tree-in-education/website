TREE Lab is dedicated to building strong roots with the communities we seek to educate and learn from. We are currently collaborating with Family Matters, Lucy Parsons Labs, and the Block Museum (details below and on our [projects](../projects/) page).

If your organization is interested in collaborating with us, please [get in touch](../contact/).
