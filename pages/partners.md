TREE Lab is dedicated to building strong roots with the communities we seek to educate and learn from. We are currently collaborating with Family Matters, Endangered Peace Productions, Lucy Parsons Labs, Evanston Township High School (ETHS), and the Block Museum (details below and on our [projects](../projects/) page).

If your organization is interested in collaborating with us, please [get in touch](../contact/).
