TREE Lab is dedicated to building strong roots with the communities with which we seek to learn. Our most recent collaborative partners include the Kapor Center, Family Matters Chicago, Endangered Peace Productions, Lucy Parsons Labs, Evanston Township High School (ETHS), and the Block Museum.

Visit our [Projects](../projects/) page to learn more about the work we do with community partners!

If your organization is interested in collaborating with us, please [get in touch](../contact/).
