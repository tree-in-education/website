<span class="first-character">T</span>he TREE (Technology, Race, Ethics, and Equity in Education) Lab within Northwestern's School of Education and Social Policy is an NSF-funded initiative that brings together NU undergraduate students with youth and community members to jointly investigate ethical, social, and racialized dimensions of new technologies. Directed by SESP Assistant Professor Sepehr Vakil, the TREE lab is fundamentally committed to reimagining the possibilities of technology learning. We design tools and environments that facilitate engagement with complex technologies in ways that make visible sociopolitical and ethical dimensions and implications.
