<span class="first-character">T</span>he TREE Lab is a large and growing groups of undergraduate and graduate students from a wide breadth of disciplines. We hold a quarterly meeting of all the project groups to align our daily actions with the larger goals of the lab. On a weekly basis, students meet with their specific project groups and regularly have check-ins with Northwestern faculty or community partners who are overseeing their growth. On occasion, project groups do collaborate with one another. For example, when our Student Journal Breakpoint reported on the anti-militarism teach-ins conducted on Northwestern's campus.

## We study the intersections of race and social justice.
We encourage growth through any ethical means possible. We encourage students to initialize their own projects and pitch them to Northwestern faculty or collaborate with community organizations in the greater Chicago area. Also, Dr. Sepehr Vakil teaches a course SESP 351 Technology and Ethics that provides undergraduate students an introduction to critically thinking about the roles of privacy, government, and how technology influences communities.
