              <p class="logline-size">Artificial intelligence, or AI, has long since made its way
                into daily conversation, once a sci-fi classic and now an imminent reality. While
                we are far from true AI, machine learning has made its way into our daily lives,
                from online shopping to self-driving cars to products like Alexa. As technology evolves
                and integrates into our lives and even into our healthcare, it's important to examine
                the impacts and ramifications it will have.

                  I'm Annika, I am a high school senior at Northside College Prep. Outside of YPRPT, I participate in my school's robotics team and a program called inSTEM at DePaul which works to engage elementary and middle school girls in STEM. In the fall I will be attending the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I plan on working in healthcare in the future, which is part of why this project examining the intersection of medicine and technology is so important to me. </p>

                  My name is Noa Levi. I am a 15 year old homeschooler. Raised in the suburbs of Chicago. I have an interest in social justice and enjoyed learning and collaborating with my team to create this documentary. Next year I will be going into sophomore year of high school. My hobbies include horseback riding, swimming and participating in my synagogueâ€™s youth group. This summer I am traveling to Tanzania to volunteer at an organization that keeps children out of orphanages and keeps them in their communities.

                <p class="bio">
                  My name is Maryam. I am from Chicago, Illinois and will be graduating from Northside College Prep and going to the University of Illinois at Chicago. In my free time I enjoy reading true crime and playing lacrosse. One of the reasons I've enjoyed exploring AI and medicine was because of my interest in medicineâ€™s relationship with bias. It has been such a pleasure being able to collaborate with all of the people of YPRPT and somehow interview all of these amazing, well-spoken and inspiring people. I appreciate being given the opportunity to gape at previous documentariesâ€™ insane creativity and hard work, and collaborate with awesome people to make one of our own!

                  Jazmin Santiago is a senior at Northside College Prep. She will attend the University of Notre Dame in the fall as a business major but became involved with YPRPT because of her interest in AI's impact on the medical field. When she is not making documentaries, she swims and plays water polo. She is really appreciative of the entire experience and learning achieved through the making of this documentary.

                  I am Elizabeth Eakin and I am the very proud team lead of the YPRPT Sparklemuffins, which Maryam, Jazmin, Annika, and Noa named after a very colorful spider that was a team favorite! I teach computer science at Northside College Prep and have truly enjoyed working with YPRPT and the Sparklemuffins this year. While I like to joke that my involvement in this program is â€˜all Maryamâ€™s faultâ€™, itâ€™s been a real pleasure to discuss artificial intelligence and its role in our society each week with the Sparklemuffins and they have completely blown me away with their amazing documentary on A.I. in medicine! Congrats team!
