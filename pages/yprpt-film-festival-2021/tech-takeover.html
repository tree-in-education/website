                    Hi, I'm Alympia Williams. I am a graduating senior from North Lawndale
                    College Prep. I will be attending my first year at Western Illinois University to study
                    Fashion Designing. Some of my favorite things to do are style hair, design clothing,
                    and just be around my friends. I join this program because I was first introduced to
                    media while working with Free Spirit Media and I enjoyed it very much. I saw this
                    as an opportunity to gain more knowledge and tell a story.

                    Hello, I'm Melody Terry. I am a sophomore attending Excel Academy
                     Southwest. Some of my favorite things to do are sing, model, and style clothes
                     because I really love fashion. I joined this program because I wanted to learn
                     something new. Learning the basic skills of filming and editing will help me to
                     create my own vlogs centered around fashion.

                    Hi everyone. My name is Merci. Iâ€™m thirteen years old.
                    Next year I'm going into 8th grade. Something special about me is that I
                    love to eat so many different types of food ranging from Thai, Mexican, Cuban,
                    and Haitian. Iâ€™ve definitely been enjoying my time with the YPRPT team;
                    this experience has been amazing. Thank you to everyone who has helped with me
                    being here!
